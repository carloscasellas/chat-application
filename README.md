# MernChat Instructions

Thank you for taking the time to check out my web chat application. This application works as a chat app in a web browser and supports file sharing as well as text messaging.

To start using it, install node.js follow these instructions.

- Open terminal, find the main chat application directory, and run the following command:

`sudo npm install yarn -g && sudo npm install nodemon -g`

- Once you have run this commmand, open another terminal and navigate to the main directory again
- Once done, run these two commands in the respective terminals

- Terminal 1:
`cd client && yarn dev`

- Terminal 2:
`cd api && nodemon index.js`

- Once this is done, Terminal 1 will prompt you with a link that will lead you to the web application. Copy that link and paste on your web browser

Congratulations, you now have MernChat up and running! Have fun!
